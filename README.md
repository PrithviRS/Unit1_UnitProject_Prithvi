<h2>Pollock on the 4th of July</h2>

by Prithvi Subrahmanyam

<h2>Description</h2>

This project is a combination of some of the concepts that I learned in Unit 1, as well as my prior knowledge. It is an interactive art piece. It creates circles at the mouse's position, which consecutively fall. If the mouse is pressed, the circles go off into another direction.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

My inspiration for this project came largely from Jackson Pollock, and Olaf Hajek. Specifically, Jackson Pollock's techniques, and his style of work. I was also inspired by the colors in Olaf Hajek's "Little Gurus".
I see this art as a very simplified version of what I'd like to be able to do. Hopefully I can continue on this project, and add in a lot more types or styles of art.

<h2>Future Updates</h2>

In the future, I'd like to add a lot of different art styles, and different artists as inspiration. I'd also like to possibly add in an idea brainstorming board where one can type and it prints onto the board for the current session.
